          I got into coding because I wanted to{" "}
          <b>solve real-world problems.</b> This problem-solving-driven
          approach, in my opinion, is a great way to approach coding. Adopting
          this self-taught coder methodology has enabled me to tackle
          increasingly complex problems, eventually leading me to become a
          software engineer at Google.

          This blog is my attempt at sharing the lessons I've learned, aiming to
          simplify learning Python (and coding in general) for everyone.

        Whether you're starting from zero or looking to advance, I'd like to
        help you through the world of coding, just as I navigated it myself.

        Having walked the self-taught path to becoming a software engineer, I
        understand that my learning method might not be the gold standard, but
        it's a path that has proven its worth for me. I share my experiences and
        insights with the hope that they can serve as a practical guide for
        others. My approach is really based in trial, error, and eventual
        success.
