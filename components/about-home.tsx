          <br />I created this site because I understand that learning Python
          can often seem daunting. This is my way of simplifying the process for
          everyone.

          My goal is for this blog to be your friendly guide in the Python
          world.
          <b> All articles aim to be 5mins or less</b> and they
          should help you cut through the clutter and focus on what truly
          matters.
